heres the story for the game, cliff notes

Little kid chillin, parents give him a gift for his birthday, its a little toy suit of armor with a wooden sword.

Somewhere in space is an evil space monster or whatever. The second the boy puts on the armor and plays pretend hero the monster gets a vision that hes going to be slayed by the boy. 

The monster goes to eartho and kills the kid in some weird soul way, the kid  didnt properly die and is a ghost that can inhabit bodies for a short amount of time

hes wandering around in his body until he sees a rift or something, he gets taken into some area where he can travel to other worlds and defeat monsters like a central hub 

He can chose what body to inhabit in this hub, what skins, weapons unlocked then chose a portal to go in and fight

every room (maybe like 10 or something) has a regular rogue like game until the boss, when he kills the boss he saves a body of some sort and brings it back to the home base

the body is maybe a wizard or a rogue or a whatever that he can now inhabit

repeat until main demon boss 

he fights the boss and each time he dies he loses a body so it swaps to another one he unlocked, goes through all 8 or so classes until the reaches his orginal body, where he ends up killing the monster dude and the scene is exactly like the original vision
